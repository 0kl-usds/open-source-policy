### Open Source Policy Exceptions

18F's Open Source Policy lists [3 classes of exceptions](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md#exceptions):

1. We don't have the rights to release the code.
2. The code's public release is restricted by a specific law or regulation (for example, arms control).
3. Some other "compelling interest" that is "rare [and] documented publicly".

Below is where we'll document exceptions from class number 3.

#### Exceptions

Right now, there are two categories of "compelling interests":

**One-off per-project exceptions**

[...none...?]

**Before the ink is dry**

One temporary and narrow (but common) exception in 18F's line of work is when our team begins work on code before formally signing and completing an "Inter-agency agreement" (IAA) with our client.

Generally speaking, until an IAA is signed, the project has not formally begun, and we are not allowed to discuss a project publicly. A code repository in this status will remain private until the IAA is signed.
