# 18F Source Code Policy

This repository contains the official [Source Code Policy](18f-source-code-policy.md) of [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) (a digital delivery team within the [General Services Administration](http://gsa.gov)).

Forked from [@cfpb](https://github.com/cfpb), with deep thanks to [@benbalter](https://github.com/benbalter) for his [insights regarding CFPB's intial policy](http://ben.balter.com/2012/04/10/whats-missing-from-cfpbs-awesome-new-source-code-policy/). For more about this policy and the philosophy behind it, see this blog entry (coming soon).
